** Image Database
Images tagged in exif or anything [[https://drewnoakes.com/code/exif/][metadata extractor]] can read with
creation date. Images are access mainly by date. 
Important access: 
- by current date in different year,
- by current month in different years
Scanning of the database could take place once a day or something 
For fast startup database can be cached in a yaml file but the real
source is just a filesystem.  

** Hardware
The system should lookout if the hdmi connection is active, and only
be active if hdmi is on. [[https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5813195/detecting-if-the-monitor-is-powered-off][ddcontrol]] might help here. Unfortunatly it
does not. It seems there is no way to learn, that a display connected
via hdmi is indeed on or tuned to the hdmi connection.
